## Board
`BOARD <you> <width> <height> <board>`
- `<you>` The character that was assigned to you
- `<width>` The width of the board
- `<height>` The height of the board
- `<board>` The encoded board. Each character is a filed in the board. You can use the formula `x = index / width` and `y = index % height`
